# BeerRecognizer

Currently crops beers out of a picture. In the future I would like it to recognise them by label.

Uploaded in rush so there is a lot of garbage.

If you want to test you have to install dependencies and run bottleFinder.py (I know it shouldn't be in camelCase :P I have to change it)
